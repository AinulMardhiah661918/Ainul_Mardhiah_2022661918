<p class="text"> I began my primary education journey at Sekolah Kebangsaan Tok Jiring when I was 7 years old in 2011. This foundational period lasted until I was 12 years old in 2016. During this time, I achieved notable results in the UPSR examination, securing 2B and 4C grades. I was proud to be part of the first batch of students to achieve 6A's during that period, a testament to our collective dedication and academic success.

<p class="text"> I began my high school journey at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Wakaf Tembesu when I was 13 years old in 2017. This foundational period lasted until I was 17 years old in 2022. During this time, I took two types of exams: PT3 at 15 years old and SPM at 17 years old, choosing accounting and business class. The SPM experience was particularly challenging due to the pandemic. I had to attend classes online during Form 4 for several months. Online classes posed various challenges, including technical issues like internet connectivity problems and software glitches. Additionally, the lack of interaction and engagement compared to in-person classes affected motivation and participation. The isolation from peers and teachers, along with home distractions, made it challenging to stay focused. Managing time between online classes, assignments, and personal responsibilities required strong organizational skills. Later on, when we resumed physical classes, strict rules were enforced to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among students. Despite these challenges, I finished school with new experiences and knowledge gained.

<p class="text"> I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Library Informatics at UiTM Kedah, where I enrolled in October 2022 after receiving my SPM results. I chose this course specifically to avoid studying mathematics, which has never been my favorite subject. I am now in my fourth semester, with the next one being the final one for this diploma. My experience here has been great, although it was challenging at first. I struggled with homesickness during the first semester, but I have since adjusted and become more independent. One of the things I appreciate most about this journey is the opportunity to make new friends and acquire new knowledge every semester. It's a significant shift from school life, as it requires a higher level of independence and self-reliance. Every semester brings different challenges in my Diploma in Library Informatics at UiTM Kedah. For instance, in the last semester, I had to tackle the Programming subject for the first time. It was a tough task as I had to develop a system using Python code within a short timeframe. Despite the difficulty, it became a memorable experience for me. I remember staying up late with my friends to work on and test the system, and their support was invaluable. I'm incredibly grateful for their help, which has been consistent throughout each semester.
